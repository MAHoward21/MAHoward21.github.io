                Hi. Hey. Hello. Welcome to my professional portfolio. This portfolio is pretty rough right now, but it is a reflection of me as a student. I am currently a student at We Can Code It, and my skills are a work in progress, just like this page. 
                Come back and see me to watch me grow! I won't fill your time with a lot of useless information
                just yet. I have so much learning to do, and would love to let my work speak for me.

                <p class="project__description">
                  To date, my favorite project we have been working through, is the Virtual Pet Shelter. This project taught me a 
                  lot about TDD (Test Driven Development). As well as a lot about using GitHub to work in teams & complete 
                  project's while working remotely. ---2021

                  My secondary project I have completed while in this cohort was not really a project,
                  however, it was an accomplishment. I have completed FizzBuzzQix. Which was a huge
                  challenge for me, just getting started. ---2021

                  are looking at right now. I have never done something like this in my life, and I am excited
